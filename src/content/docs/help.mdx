## Ask a question or Get Help

The best way to reach me is through my [email](contact.ceciliamay@gmail.com), since I check them everyday.

If you have Twitter, you can @ or DM me at **@ceciliamay_** or through Primary's Twitter page, **@primarytheme**.

You can also try messaging me through [Obsidian's Discord Group](https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd), but I seldom check on there and might be late on replying. 

## Submit a Bug

Having some weird issues? Found something that doesn't work as expected? Consider filing a bug at the [Issues Page](https://github.com/primary-theme/obsidian/issues).

If you don't have a **GitHub Account**, you may report it via [email](contact.ceciliamay@gmail.com) instead.

Before submitting a report, consider following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Make sure Primary is up to date
2. Make sure a related Community Plugin is up to date
3. Everytime you update Primary or change between themes, restart the app
4. Check if any of your CSS Snippets are causing the issue
5. Make sure the bug is reproducible only through the Primary theme. If it is reproducible through the Default theme, it is not a Primary bug. It is either an Obsidian bug, Community Plugin bug, or CSS Snippet bug. Consider posting the bug at their respective support places.
6. When posting an issue at the **Issues Page**, please check first if your issue has been posted already (to prevent duplication).
</Steps>

Other than that, please follow the template when submitting an issue!

## Submit a Theme Feature

Have a feature you'd like get added to Primary or as an option in Style Settings? Or maybe you want a specific guide in the doc site? Consider filing a feature request at the [Issues Page](https://github.com/primary-theme/obsidian/issues).

Before submitting a feature request, consider following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Only submit feature requests for Primary as a theme. If you have a request towards Obsidian as the app, please submit it through the correct channels such as their Obsidian Discord or through the Obsidian Forums.
2. For feature requests for certain plugins please headover to their respective GitHub/Issue pages and post there.
3. When posting a feature request at the **Issues Page**, please check first if your request has been posted already (to prevent duplication).
</Steps>

Other than that, please follow the template when submitting a request!

## Compatibility with CSS Snippets or Plugins

Primary does not guarantee it will work with your existing CSS Snippets or downloaded Community Plugins
