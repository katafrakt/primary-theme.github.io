![Custom Icons using Flaticons UIcons](/src/media/demos/interface_custom-icons.png)

Primary offers custom iconography out of the box using the [Flaticons UIcons Library](https://www.flaticon.com/icon-fonts-most-downloaded) in the Regular Rounded style.

Primary also keeps some of Obsidian's original icons (they use the [Lucide Icon Library](https://lucide.dev/icons/)), if those icons are deemed a better fit for its usage. Lucide and Flaticons fit well together!

If you're a plugin developer using Primary and are considering using icons that fit well with Primary, I would like to suggest to go for using Lucide as their icons are more universally flattering for other non-Primary users.
