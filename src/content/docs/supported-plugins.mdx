Primary is built to be close to the Obsidian layout as possible.

There isn't a lot of major realigning, reformatting, or restyling on top. This should make Primary easily compatible with a lot of plugins. As long as the plugin creator designs appropriately with the Obsidian's provided components and with the Obsidian default theme in mind, it'll likely look similar within Primary.

Nonetheless, I've given some extra love to certain plugins.

## Community Plugins

Primary should generally support Community Plugins out of the box, since Primary has properly styled all Obsidian components. Some Community Plugins are given extra support though, to better fit the theme. 

Here's a list of plugins tried and tested to fit with Primary:

- [Advanced Canvas](obsidian://show-plugin?id=advanced-canvas)
- [Calendar](obsidian://show-plugin?id=calendar)
- [Hider](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-hider)
- [Iconize](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-icon-folder)
- [Kanban](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-kanban)
- [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings)

I'm open to supporting more plugins if they have a wide enough user base or deserve the much needed support.

Otherwise, feel free to send a pull request if you'd like to contribute support for your/your favorite plugin!
