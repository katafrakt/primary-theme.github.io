Primary was built to be easily customizable. Whether through creating your own snippets, using Style Settings, or imported presets applied to Style Settings, Primary was built so that you can perfect it to your liking.

Primary doesn't offer various Obsidian UI layout options though compared to other themes.

Customizations beyond Font Recommendations require Style Settings to access.

If you prefer not to use Style Settings, you can opt to creating CSS Snippets. The latter option requires you some CSS knowledge and tinkering skills. Members in the `#appearance-dev` channel on [Obsidian Discord](https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd) are more than happy to help you out though!
