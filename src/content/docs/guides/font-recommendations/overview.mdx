In this section, we'll be going over some alternative fonts you can use with Primary, tested and curated to be paired well with Primary.

Each font recommendation will include a guide on how to install it and suggestions on the setup. We will also note if it's best for headings, headings and body text, interface, monospace, etc.

This section will grow over time. Both free and paid fonts will be added (with the bias of posting free ones of course!). If you'd like to be notified for future additions to this section, consider subscribing to Primary Theme Updates to get the news right in your inbox!
